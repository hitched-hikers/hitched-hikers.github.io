To arrive at the trailhead was quite a journey! We started our day with a ferry from Minori to Amalfi.

We then took a coach bus from Amalfi to Bomerano where we met up with two of our friends, Cat (second from the right) and Will (first from the right).

The trail starts on a moutainside overlooking the sea. Along the way we noticed many farms embedded in the mountain facess, some were definitely abandoned.

We tried to get the attention of a baby sheep dog, with no luck. We did however get the attention of some very malnourished cats. Below you will see a picture of Emily feeding a cat a whole bag of crackers. If you decide to visit this part of Italy and love cats, we suggest you bring tuna cans (or cat snacks)... lots of 'em.

The rest of the hike was relatively flat. We stopped for pictures and to occasionally look over the mountain side... the drop was steep.
We even encountered a rock climbing group. If you rock climb and visit this area of Italy, you should do some research into equipment rental.

To reward ourselves after the hike, we stopped at a hut that served sandwiches and drinks. The food was so delicious and the aperol spritz was even better. We wondered how they transported the fresh produce up the hill but understood after hearing donkeys braying.
