During our visit to Amalfi, we stayed in the tiny town of Minori. Minori is this amazing little town which has all the quintessential features of an Amalfi coast town, minus the tourism. Minori is full of narrow roads, scooters, honking busses, small markets, and stairs.

Upon arriving at our Airbnb, our host gave us the name of a few hikes in the area we could do. He told us about this old church, the church of San Nicola, situated at the top of a mountain on the coast. He told us we could reach it via this trail called the Path of the Lemons. We checked out the trail on AllTrails, and decided to go up the next morning. And so began our little trek through "il sentiero dei limoni."

The hike started with many stairs. Many, many stairs. We climbed up and out of Minori through an elaborate network of stairs which climbed up through the houses of the locals. Imagine how in shape you would be if you had to climb 200 stairs a day just to get groceries?

On our way up we spotted the church perched on a hilltop in the distance.

Each stairway and turn through the path lead us to new views. We saw the sea, lemon farms, and many cats.

The path took us up and out of Minori where we caught a glimpse of the next town over, Maiori. Here, the path cuts into the woods and takes us out the narrow village pathways and into the nature.

In this wooded path, you become completely absolutely enveloped in a strong smell of lemon. I have never breathed air in deeper. The smell was so fresh and sweet. I sadly did not get any pictures of the lemon trees in the path, but got some pictures of lemons at the market. Lemons in Amalfi are much bigger and sweeter than the ones we get in North American supermarkets.

Finally, we reached the church. We walked around soaking in the views and appreciating the old age of this church. We also spotted a bunch of wild herbs, among which rosemary.

It was founded in the 11th century! Absolutely ancient.

We finished our hike with a descend into Maiori. Once we reached Maiori, we walked on the road to get back to Amalfi.

Once home, we made a delicious meal and called it a day before heading out on a second hike the next day, [Path of the Gods](https://hitched-hikers.github.io/#/hikes/path-of-the-gods).
